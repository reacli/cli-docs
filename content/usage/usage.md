#### If **Reacli** is installed globally

Once you have **Reacli** globally installed (see [installation]({{< relref "install.md" >}})), you can directly use it like this:

```bash
reacli component path/to/my/component
```

#### If you did not install **Reacli**

You don't need to have **Reacli** installed globally to use it. You can use `npx` to run it wherever you want:

```bash
npx reacli component path/to/my/component
```
